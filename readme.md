Hello, this is my first markdown file for demo wiki  
`I can make funny text, this gray background is commonly used to mark text one should type into a command line`
We could use many different files, such as html or even pdf and word document (~~I believe~~ I tested, see AnchorManuscript). What you see here is a simpple markdown (md). 
Not sure that is the best, but markdown seems pretty convenient.

## JOB TASK FOR EVERYONE: 
**learn how to add a file to my repository**   
It's public so you can clone it to your local computer, using `git clone https://github.com/mschira/markFirstGit`, then you need to fork it, change it i.e. add an extra md or html file, commit to your branch, then you can ask to merge (merge request).
* more concrete suggestion: create a simple YOURSUGGESTION.md add some text like:  
*Jess make their first lab document and it's awesome.*   
* If you want to do something simpler: make your OWN repsitory, if you do that, you can save yourself the pain of forking and merge request.

To use git I suggest two basic ways: command line of VSCode.
I personally find command line easier for some things, VSCode is sometimes not doing what I expect it to do, but I REALLY like the editor with the build in preview. It let's you see what your markdown file will look like.

Here are basic videos about VSCode and Git:

Since vscode is a bit of a learning curve, maybe some basic git push pull and any text editor makes it easier?

* first one to succceed with that gets a beer on Thursday!   
* those who attended the Brainhack are probably massively advantaged but **DON'T give up before you try** I think this is something we should all be able to do to work on shared documentation!
