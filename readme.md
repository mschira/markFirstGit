Hello, this is my first markdown file for demo wiki
`I can make funny text`
We could use many different files, such as html or even pdf and word document (I believe). Right now all I am using is markdown (md). 
Not sure that is the best, but markdown seems pretty convenient.

## JOB TASK FOR EVERYONE: 
**learn how to add a file to my repository**
It's public, but you need to fork it, change it, add an extra md or html file, commit to your branch, then ask to merge.
* more concrete suggestion: create a simple YOURSUGGESTION.md add some text like Jess makes their first lab document and it's awesome
You could use this page to get some basic instruction how to do this with VSCODE

vscode is a bit of a learning curve, maybe some basic git push pull and any text editor makes it easier?

* first one to succceed with that gets a beer on Thursday!
* those who attended the Brainhack are probably massively advantaged but **DON'T give up before you try** I think this is something we should all be able to do to work on shared documentation!
